so i can just copy this(shadcn components) and use it?? i dont have to do additional import export anywhere else to make it working?

Yes ‚Äî you can just copy this whole file into your project (e.g. at components/ui/toast.tsx) and it will work.
But ‚ö†Ô∏è you need to make sure a few supporting things are set up:

‚úÖ What you need besides this file

Dependencies must be installed
Run this once in your project:

npm install @radix-ui/react-toast class-variance-authority lucide-react << this (1)


cn utility function must exist
In shadcn projects, it usually lives in lib/utils.ts.
If you don‚Äôt already have it, create lib/utils.ts with:

import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}

======================================================

npm install @radix-ui/react-toast class-variance-authority lucide-react
 << how do i know if its already been installed?

Great question üëå because if you install stuff twice you‚Äôll just waste time.
Here‚Äôs how you can check if a package is already installed in your project:

üîç Method 1: Look in package.json

Open the file package.json in the root of your project.

Scroll down to "dependencies" (or "devDependencies").

If you see something like this:

"dependencies": {
  "@radix-ui/react-toast": "^1.1.4",
  "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.0",
  "lucide-react": "^0.312.0"
}


‚úÖ That means it‚Äôs installed.

üîç Method 2: Use npm list

Run this command inside your project folder (C:\Users\Sabit\Desktop\marketapp>):

npm list @radix-ui/react-toast class-variance-authority lucide-react << this (2)


If they are installed ‚Üí you‚Äôll see their version numbers.

If not installed ‚Üí you‚Äôll see (empty) or -- (not installed).
